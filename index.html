        <p>
          Thank you for asking to look over my portfolio.
          Within this portfolio, you will find projects I have done.
        </p>
        <p> 
          My infatuation with coding started when I was introduced to a program called Cabinet Vision.
          Once I started to learn how to use the program, I noticed that you could make UCS's (user constructed standards).
          By looking at what other people had made and trial and error, I learned how to make my own UCS's.
          After about six years of doing this, my boss asked me to look into being able to code websites and another programming.
          From that, I found a course at UWA Coding Boot Camp.
          This portfolio was created as one of the homework assignments.
          So far all i have to add is the Catman shooting game i made, but I will update it as I go.
